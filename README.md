Code required for simulations in the paper.

The simulations were spun up for 17,000 years using precip0.bin, evap0.bin, and snowprecip0.bin.  Then, precip.bin, evap.bin, and snowprecip.bin contain precipitation values for E_0 = 0.05 to E_0 = 3 with a spacing of 0.05.  The data.exf then contains the information that states how frequently a new E_0 value is used.  The simulation runs with E_0 being smoothly changed between these values.  

In addition, we run brief hysteresis experiments as described in the manuscript.
